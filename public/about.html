<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sumit Kumar, I am a Web Developer, I am pursuing b.Tech in Coumputer Science and Engg. </p>
<p>I completed Diploma Engg. in Civil Engg.,
  After completing Diploma I changed my branch because I do not feel much intrest in civil engg & 
  I am very curious about How the technology works,
  Here in CSE I can make new technology that can make our life more easy instead of following fixed instruction(written in IS codes based on many experiments) </p>
